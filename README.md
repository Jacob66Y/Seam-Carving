# Seam-Carving

Implemented a content-aware image resizing algorithm in Python to remove vertical and horizontal seams while preserving essential visual features. Applied dynamic programming to identify low-energy pixel paths, enabling intelligent resizing without distortion. Demonstrated understanding of computer vision principles and their application in modern graphics tools like Adobe Photoshop.
